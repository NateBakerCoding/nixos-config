# NixOS Configuration Repository

Welcome to my NixOS configuration repository! This setup is designed for a fully declarative and modular configuration, making it easy to manage and reproduce my system setup. Below is an overview of the repository structure and key components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have NixOS installed with Flakes enabled. If you're new to NixOS, check out the [official installation guide](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/).

### Setting Up the Configuration
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NateBakerCoding/nixos-config.git
   cd nixos-config
   ```
2. Build and apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
   ```

3. For user-specific configurations managed by Home Manager: (make sure to use your username and change it in the home-manager/home.nix file)
   ```bash
   home-manager switch --flake .#<username-here>  
   ```

## Key Features
- **Declarative Configuration**: All system and user settings are defined in code.
- **Modular Design**: Components are separated into logical modules for maintainability.
- **Reproducibility**: Flakes ensure that the system configuration is consistent across setups.
- **Custom Overlays**: Tailor packages to specific needs using custom overlays.

## Modules Overview
### `modules/`
This directory contains system-wide configurations, split into logical units:
- **audio.nix**: Handles audio settings and optimizations.
- **desktop.nix**: Configures general desktop environment settings.
- **gnome.nix**: Adds GNOME-specific tweaks and extensions.
- **hardware.nix**: Configures system hardware.
- **hardware-configuration.nix**: Just a copy of the file autogenerated on install at /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix
- **networking.nix**: Manages network interfaces and connectivity.
- **nvidia.nix**: Ensures NVIDIA GPU support.
- **services.nix**: Defines systemd services and applications.

### `home-manager/`
Manages user-specific configurations for applications and environments. Split into modular files for easy customization.
💡 Tip: Since I'm the only user on this machine, I focus on managing dotfiles here. System-level configs could technically move here, but I prefer separating them.

### `overlays/`
Defines custom overlays to modify or add packages not available in the default Nixpkgs.
Currently using this to make nix beleive my nvim theme is a nix pkg ;) look at the nvim-config.nix file and you will see why
